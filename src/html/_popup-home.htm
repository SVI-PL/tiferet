										Learning Torah on a high level not only challenges your mind. It also elevates your soul. With text of classical sources in every Shiur, you watch the text come to life as our Dream Team of teachers (as one high school principle called it) delve inside. The variety of classes are dizzying. In fact, the biggest complaint we receive from students is that it’s so hard to choose from all the options. They want to take every single one! But don’t fret. You can always make a Chavruta with your teachers on any topic you wish. On average each students has at least 5 Chavruta’s with teachers and complete many Sefarim.

										Tiferet is the ONLY seminary in Israel where all administrators live within walking distance of the campus. This enables the teachers to be much more involved in the students lives and religious growth. Whether it's to shmooze, to seek advice, to ask questions or to learn in Chavruta, Tiferet teachers only
										live minutes away.
										All of the Tiferet staff consistently open their homes to their students for informal Shiur, Vaad, Chug or BBQ. The teachers home is an extension of the Tiferet campus. Since Tiferet never closes, you are always welcome to stay in Tiferet for Shabbat or Yom Tov and join your teachers for meals.
										Tiferet is more than just a school. It is a community.
